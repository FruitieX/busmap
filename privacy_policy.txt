Privacy-relevant Android permissions requested by this app

LOCATION

The busmap app uses the location permission in order to display the user's
current location on the map, as well as zoom in on an area near the user when
the app starts. Location information is neither collected, nor transmitted over
the network in any way.

The application's permission request can be denied, and then no user location
is visible on the map, and the map defaults to displaying a preselected region
of the Helsinki area.
